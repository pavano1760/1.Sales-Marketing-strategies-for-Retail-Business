The Apriori algorithm is used for mining frequent itemsets and devising association rules from a transactional database. The parameters “support” and “confidence” are used. Support refers to items’ frequency of occurrence; confidence is a conditional probability.

Items in a transaction form an item set. The algorithm begins by identifying frequent, individual items (items with a frequency greater than or equal to the given support) in the database and continues to extend them to larger, frequent itemsets.

Price elasticity of demand (PED) shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded and provides a precise calculation of the effect of a change in price on quantity demanded.

Price elasticity measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded or supplied of a good to a change in its price. It is computed as the percentage change in quantity demanded (or supplied) divided by the percentage change in price.
